# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

WriteMagic takes security seriously. As a cross-platform writing application that handles user content and integrates with AI services, we implement multiple layers of security to protect user data and maintain system integrity.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All user documents are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Secure Key Management**: API keys stored in platform-specific secure keystores
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use
- **PII Detection**: Content filtering before AI processing

### AI Integration Security
- **Provider Isolation**: Each AI provider runs in isolated contexts
- **Content Filtering**: Automatic detection and filtering of sensitive information
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and cost overruns
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of AI interactions

### Mobile Security
- **Platform Guidelines**: Following iOS and Android security best practices
- **App Sandboxing**: Proper file system permissions and data isolation
- **Network Security**: Certificate pinning and secure communication
- **Biometric Authentication**: Optional biometric protection for sensitive features

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Regular vulnerability scanning of Docker images
- **Dependency Auditing**: Automated dependency vulnerability checks
- **Secret Management**: No secrets in code, secure secret distribution
- **CI/CD Security**: Signed builds and verified artifacts

## üö® Supported Versions

We actively support security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## üìù Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in WriteMagic, please report it responsibly.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** send details to our security team privately

### Contact Information

- **Email**: security@writemagic.dev
- **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 24 hours
- **Updates**: You will receive regular updates on the status of your report

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your security report:

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact and severity assessment
4. Suggested mitigation or fix (if any)
5. Your contact information for follow-up
6. Any additional context or supporting materials
```

### Example Report Format

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Buffer overflow in FFI string handling

Description:
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Rust FFI layer when handling 
extremely long document titles from the mobile applications.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a document with a title > 65536 characters
2. Save the document through the mobile interface
3. Observe memory corruption in the Rust core

Impact:
This could potentially lead to code execution on the device and 
compromise user data.

Suggested Fix:
Implement proper bounds checking in the FFI string conversion functions.

## üîç Security Research Guidelines

We welcome security research conducted in a responsible manner. Please follow these guidelines:

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- WriteMagic mobile applications (iOS/Android)
- Rust core engine and FFI boundaries
- AI integration and data handling
- Build and deployment infrastructure
- Dependencies and third-party integrations

**Out of Scope:**
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks on user devices
- Attacks requiring physical access to development infrastructure
- Vulnerabilities in third-party AI services (report to respective vendors)

### Testing Guidelines

**Allowed:**
- Static code analysis and dependency auditing
- Dynamic analysis on your own installations
- Network traffic analysis (with your own data)
- Reverse engineering of mobile applications

**Not Allowed:**
- Attacking production infrastructure
- Accessing other users' data
- Denial of service attacks
- Automated vulnerability scanning without permission

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Development Practices

### Secure Coding Standards

**Rust Core:**
- No `unsafe` code without thorough review and documentation
- Comprehensive input validation at FFI boundaries
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Memory safety through Rust's ownership system

**Mobile Development:**
```kotlin
// Android: Secure data handling
class SecureDocumentStorage {
    private val keyAlias = "writemagic_document_key"
    
    fun storeDocument(content: String): Boolean {
        return try {
            val encryptedContent = encryptWithKeystore(content, keyAlias)
            saveToSecureStorage(encryptedContent)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            // Log error without exposing sensitive data
            false
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
// iOS: Secure data handling
class SecureDocumentStorage {
    private let serviceName = "com.writemagic.documents"
    
    func storeDocument(_ content: String) -> Bool {
        guard let data = content.data(using: .utf8) else { return false }
        
        let query: [String: Any] = [
            kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
            kSecAttrService as String: serviceName,
            kSecValueData as String: data,
            kSecAttrAccessible as String: kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly
        ]
        
        return SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil) == errSecSuccess
    }
}
```

### AI Security Patterns

```rust
// Content filtering before AI processing
pub struct ContentFilter {
    pii_detector: PiiDetector,
    sensitive_patterns: Vec<Regex>,
}

impl ContentFilter {
    pub fn filter_content(&self, content: &str) -> Result<String> {
        // Remove PII
        let filtered = self.pii_detector.redact_pii(content)?;
        
        // Apply additional filtering
        let safe_content = self.apply_sensitive_patterns(&filtered)?;
        
        Ok(safe_content)
    }
}
```

### Dependency Security

We use automated tools to monitor and manage security in our dependencies:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
- name: Audit Rust dependencies
  run: |
    cargo audit
    cargo deny check
    
- name: Scan container images
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: 'writemagic:latest'
    format: 'sarif'
```

## üîê Cryptography

### Encryption Standards

**Data at Rest:**
- Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
- Key Derivation: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Salt: 32-byte random salt per document

**Data in Transit:**
- TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- Certificate pinning for critical endpoints
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) support

**Key Management:**
- iOS: Keychain Services with hardware security module support
- Android: Android Keystore with hardware backing when available
- Server: HSM or cloud KMS for production keys

### Implementation Example

```rust
use aes_gcm::{Aes256Gcm, Key, Nonce};
use pbkdf2::pbkdf2_hmac;
use sha2::Sha256;

pub struct DocumentEncryption {
    cipher: Aes256Gcm,
}

impl DocumentEncryption {
    pub fn encrypt_document(&self, content: &str, password: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
        let salt = generate_random_salt();
        let key = derive_key(password, &salt)?;
        let nonce = generate_nonce();
        
        let ciphertext = self.cipher.encrypt(&nonce, content.as_bytes())?;
        
        // Prepend salt and nonce to ciphertext
        let mut result = salt.to_vec();
        result.extend_from_slice(&nonce);
        result.extend_from_slice(&ciphertext);
        
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

## üìä Security Monitoring
