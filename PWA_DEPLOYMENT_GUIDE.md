## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended)

#### Netlify Deployment
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy from web-app directory
cd web-app
netlify deploy --prod --dir=public

# Configure custom domain (optional)
netlify domains:add yourdomain.com
```

```

#### GitHub Pages
```bash
# Configure repository for GitHub Pages
# 1. Go to repository Settings
# 2. Enable Pages from main branch /web-app/public folder
# 3. Configure custom domain if needed

# Or use gh-pages for automated deployment
npm install -g gh-pages
gh-pages -d web-app/public
```

### Option 2: Full WASM Build (Advanced)

For the complete experience with Rust WASM integration:

```bash
# Install wasm-pack (if not already installed)
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Build WASM modules
cd core/wasm
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg

# Copy to web-app
cp -r pkg/* ../../web-app/core/wasm/pkg/

# Deploy with full WASM support
```

## 🔧 Configuration for Production

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create `web-app/public/.env` (if using build system):
```env
# Production configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PWA_NAME="WriteMagic - AI Writing Assistant"
PWA_SHORT_NAME="WriteMagic"
PWA_DESCRIPTION="Professional AI-powered writing application"
PWA_THEME_COLOR="#4f46e5"
