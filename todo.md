## Completed This Sprint
- [x] [PROJECT-MANAGER] ‚úÖ Created project specification document (SPECS_IMPROVED.md) - 2025-01-18
- [x] [PROJECT-MANAGER] ‚úÖ Established sub-agent team structure - 2025-01-18
- [x] [PROJECT-MANAGER] ‚úÖ Set up project task management system - 2025-01-18
- [x] [PROJECT-MANAGER] ‚úÖ Created sub-agent coordination YAML configurations - 2025-01-18

## Agent Status
- **Project Manager**: ‚úÖ Active - Coordinating initial sprint setup
- **Mobile Architect**: üü° Ready - Awaiting Rust core foundation
- **AI Integration**: üü° Ready - Planning provider abstraction design
- **Rust Core**: üîµ Active - Designing core architecture
- **UX Writing**: üîµ Active - Creating initial wireframes
- **DevOps Platform**: üü° Ready - Awaiting initial implementations for CI/CD setup

## Sprint Goals (January 18-25, 2025)
1. **Foundation**: Establish Rust core and mobile project structures
2. **Architecture**: Define key interfaces and abstractions
3. **Automation**: Set up basic CI/CD pipeline
4. **Design**: Create initial UX wireframes and specifications
5. **Integration**: Prove cross-platform FFI integration works

## Risks and Blockers
- **Risk**: FFI complexity between Rust and mobile platforms
  - Mitigation: Start with simple interface, iterate and expand
- **Risk**: AI provider API rate limits during development
  - Mitigation: Implement local mocking, use development API keys
- **Blocker**: None currently identified

## Next Sprint Preview (January 25 - February 1, 2025)
- Basic text editing functionality
- AI provider integration
- Multi-pane interface implementation
- Database integration
- Basic git operations
