# Jobs To Be Done - WriteMagic

## Core Framework
*"People don't buy products; they hire them to do a job."* - Clayton Christensen

WriteMagic isn't hired to be a word processor. It's hired to solve deeper, more fundamental jobs that arise in the messy reality of creative writing.

## Competing Against Non-Consumption

The biggest competition isn't other writing apps—it's **not writing at all**.

People choose non-consumption when:
- The tools make writing feel harder than not writing
- The blank page is more intimidating than avoidance
- The process feels artificial or forced
- Technology gets between thought and expression

WriteMagic competes against non-consumption by:
- Reducing activation energy to start
- Making progress visible and celebrated
- Removing technical friction
- Respecting the craft while supporting the crafter

## Anti-Jobs (What WriteMagic is NOT Hired For)

- **Generate writing for me** → We amplify, not replace
- **Fix my discipline problems** → We reduce friction, not create motivation
- **Make me famous** → We improve craft, not guarantee outcomes
- **Replace human feedback** → We supplement, not substitute
- **Write like someone else** → We enhance your voice, not change it

---

## Integration Points

The job gets done when WriteMagic successfully integrates into:
- **Morning routine**: Open app = start writing
- **Commute**: Phone writing = real progress
- **Lunch breaks**: Quick scene additions
- **Evening wind-down**: Review and plan
- **Weekend sessions**: Deep work enabled

The job is done when writers say:
> "I can't imagine writing without it."

Not because of features, but because it consistently solves the real jobs they need done.
