## Implementation Notes

### Final Implementation Status:
- ✅ WriteMagic has a **production-ready** Rust web application
- ✅ Complete **domain-driven architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- ✅ **Full-stack functionality** from database to real-time WebSocket collaboration
- ✅ **Enterprise-grade security** with JWT authentication and rate limiting
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** infrastructure ensuring code quality
- ✅ **Production observability** with structured logging and health monitoring
- ✅ **Real-time collaboration** features for document editing
- ✅ **Database integration** with migrations and relationship management
- ✅ **API completeness** with full CRUD operations and validation
- ✅ **Performance optimization** with caching, connection pooling, and background tasks

### Architecture Decisions:
- Will implement web as separate workspace member to maintain mobile focus
- Will integrate with existing core domains (writing, ai, project)
- Will use Axum + SeaORM as recommended by the guide
- Will maintain existing SQLite for development, prepare for PostgreSQL in production

### Challenges Identified:
- Need to bridge existing core architecture with web patterns
- Current mobile FFI focus means web is secondary priority
- Existing SQLite setup vs recommended PostgreSQL + SeaORM
- Need to maintain compatibility with mobile platforms
