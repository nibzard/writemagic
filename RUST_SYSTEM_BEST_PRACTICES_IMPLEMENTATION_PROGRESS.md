## Files Modified in This Session

### Phase 1 - Project Foundation & Core Patterns

**New Files Created:**
- `rust-toolchain.toml` - Pinned toolchain to Rust 1.84 with required components
- `.cargo/config.toml` - Performance optimizations (mold linker, target-cpu=native)
- `core/shared/src/buffer_pool.rs` - High-performance buffer pool and zero-copy patterns
- `core/shared/src/shutdown.rs` - Graceful shutdown patterns with CancellationToken
- `RUST_SYSTEM_BEST_PRACTICES_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` - This tracking document

**Files Modified:**
- `Cargo.toml` - Updated to edition 2024, Rust 1.84, modern dependencies, workspace lints
- `core/shared/src/error.rs` - Enhanced with structured error responses, backtrace capture
- `core/shared/src/lib.rs` - Added re-exports for new modules
- `core/shared/Cargo.toml` - Added performance dependencies (smallvec, arrayvec, bytes, tokio-util)

## Notes

- Focus on MVP-relevant improvements first (Android + core)
- Skip iOS-specific improvements until post-MVP
- Prioritize memory safety and performance in hot paths
- All changes should maintain backward compatibility
