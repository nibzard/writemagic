## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Fast execution, no Android dependencies
- Mock FFI operations for testing without native library
- Focused on business logic and data handling
- **Run with:** `./gradlew test`

### 2. Integration Tests
- Medium execution time, requires Android emulator/device
- Tests actual FFI integration when native library is available
- Validates data flow between Android and Rust core
- **Run with:** `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest`

### 3. UI Tests
- Tests Compose UI components and interactions
- Validates user workflows and screen transitions
- Tests accessibility and performance under load
- **Run with:** `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest`

### 4. End-to-End Tests
- Complete user scenarios from app launch to completion
- Tests realistic usage patterns and edge cases
- Validates data persistence and state management
- **Run with:** `./gradlew connectedE2EAndroidTest`

## Test Execution Commands

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Unit tests only (fast)
./gradlew test

# All tests including UI/integration
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Specific test classes
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest --tests "com.writemagic.ui.WritingWorkflowTest"
```

### Test Suites
```bash
# Smoke tests (essential functionality)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest --tests "com.writemagic.WriteMagicSmokeTestSuite"

# Performance tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest --tests "com.writemagic.WriteMagicPerformanceTestSuite"

# Full test suite
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest --tests "com.writemagic.WriteMagicTestSuite"
```

### Test Reports
Test results are generated in:
- `app/build/reports/tests/testDebugUnitTest/` - Unit test reports
- `app/build/reports/androidTests/connected/` - Instrumentation test reports

## Testing Without Native Library

The test suite is designed to work even when the Rust native library is not available:

1. **Unit Tests** - Use mock data and validate Android-side logic
2. **FFI Tests** - Catch `UnsatisfiedLinkError` and validate error handling
3. **UI Tests** - Test UI components independently of backend functionality
4. **Integration Tests** - Mock FFI responses for UI validation

## Test Data and Helpers

### TestHelpers.kt Features
- **Sample Data** - Predefined test content with various edge cases
- **Navigation Helpers** - Common navigation patterns for UI tests
- **Content Helpers** - Document and project creation utilities
- **Performance Tools** - Timing and memory usage measurement
- **Assertions** - Common test validations and verifications

### Test Data Includes
- Unicode content with emojis and international characters
- Large documents for performance testing
- Edge cases with special characters and formatting
- Realistic user content for workflow testing

## Key Testing Principles
